# swiftui-hide-toolbar-icons-onscroll
Example of hiding toolbar icons in a navigation bar when scrolling. The icons hide when scrolling down and reappear when scrolling up. Uses SwiftUI and the new onScrollPhaseChange modifier in iOS 18. For a cleaner look, the icons are hidden by changing the opacity.
